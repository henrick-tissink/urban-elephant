    "founderTitle": "Founder & Chief Elephant Wrangler",
    "intro": "Hey there! I'm Niles—founder, owner, and self-appointed Chief Elephant Wrangler at Urban Elephant. Originally from the UK (where the weather builds character), I made the move to Cape Town back in 2007.",
    "story1": "After globe-trotting and seeing the best (and worst) the world has to offer, I knew I'd found something truly special in the Mother City. So, I unpacked my bags, ditched the umbrella, and set out to build something a little different in the world of hospitality.",
    "story2": "That's how Urban Elephant was born—a place where luxury meets comfort, where style doesn't break the bank, and where every guest feels like a rockstar (or at the very least, a very well-looked-after human).",
    "story3": "I genuinely love meeting new people, hearing their stories, and helping them create incredible memories while they're in Cape Town. I've built Urban Elephant around this idea: personalised, thoughtful service that goes the extra mile (and sometimes the extra bottle of wine).",
    "story4": "Every apartment is designed to make you feel at home—but better. Because let's be honest, who wants to do housekeeping at home?",
    "team": "Of course, none of this would be possible without my amazing team. From our superstar Guest Relations Managers to the housekeeping heroes who keep everything spotless, they're the heart of Urban Elephant. They're friendly, professional, and always up for a good laugh—or a restaurant recommendation.",

      "story1": "When I was six years old, Zola was my constant companion. She brought comfort, calm, and a quiet reminder that standing out could be something beautiful. While I was captivated by Africa's wild animals, it was this small pink elephant that taught me the power of individuality and warmth.",
      "story2": "Years later, that simple lesson became the heart and emblem of Urban Elephant — a brand built on care, character, and connection.",
      "story3": "Zola now lives on in our emblem. Her name, which means 'peaceful' and 'calm' in Xhosa, reflects the feeling we want every guest to experience.",
      "closing": "At Urban Elephant, you're more than a visitor. You're part of a story that celebrates comfort, creativity, and belonging — the same feeling Zola once gave me."
